## Workshop Overview

The AWS EKS Red Team Masterclass - From Exploitation to Defense is an immersive workshop designed to take participants through real-world scenarios of attacking and defending Kubernetes clusters hosted on AWS EKS.

This workshop provides a comprehensive approach, from understanding the anatomy of attacks on EKS clusters using AWS ECR to deploying robust defense mechanisms. Participants will learn how to backdoor AWS ECR image & exploit misconfigurations and vulnerabilities within AWS EKS, followed by the implementation of best security practices to safeguard the environment.
